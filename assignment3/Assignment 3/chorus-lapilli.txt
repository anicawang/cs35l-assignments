Chorus Lapilli Notes
after implementing the tic tac toe game, there were a few changes 
required to change it into a chorus lapilli game:
•	first, I set up 3 turns for each player
o	each player can only have 3 pieces on the board at once, 
	for a total of 6 pieces maximum at a time
o	if they already have 3 pieces, they must select a piece 
	and then move it to a valid spot
	check that the move is valid 
	check if there is a piece in the center
•	if there is, it must be moved
•	otherwise it must be a winning move
o	all of this was modified in the handleClick function to 
	cater to the new rules in the game
•	to move a piece
o	store previous spot in order to check if new space is
	valid
o	select an existing piece and turn it blank
	like player “picked it up”
o	select a blank space that is a valid place to move (has 
	to be adjacent to previous spot and cannot have a piece 
	already there)
	if the player selects the same square the piece was 
	originally on, they still need to complete a move
	change turns after every valid move
o	reject invalid moves
